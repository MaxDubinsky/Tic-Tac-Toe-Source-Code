### Hello, visitor!
It's the famous, simple game Tic Tac Toe made with C++ programming language, IDE: "Visual Studio".
I'm beginner with C++, I have only 1 year experience with this language, so my skills are not enough to build something VERY BIG and I decided to practice my skills with C++, started with all what I know from the start.
Also, wanted to say about very annoying thing in every program - **BUGS**. There's really many bugs but in future, I will fix it anyway.
## About bugs and future fixes:
- Bot can't win.
- Bot is very easy.
- Maybe adding some functional or interface as additional.
